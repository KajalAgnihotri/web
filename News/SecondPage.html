<h3>Counting Of Votes In Gujarat Rajya Sabha Polls Delayed As Congress, BJP Approach Election Commission: 10 Points</h3>
</div><!--jumbotron ends here-->
<p>GANDHINAGAR:  Counting of votes has been delayed in the nail-biting Rajya Sabha election for three seats in Gujarat, with the Congress asking the Election Commission to reject the votes of two of its rebels. The BJP has protested and demanded that counting begin at once. A taut suspense continues over the fate of senior Congress leader Ahmed Patel, who is struggling to get re-elected to the Upper House of Parliament with the BJP going all out to try and defeat him, turning the election into a big prestige battle. BJP chief Amit Shah, who makes his debut in Parliament, and union minister Smriti Irani will win the other two seats.</p>
<p>The Congress has asked the Election Commission to invalidate the vote of two of its legislators who, after showing their ballot papers to the Congress election agent, also showed the BJP's agent how they had voted, which the party said violates polling norms. The attempt is to bring down the total number of votes needed by each candidate today.</p>
<p>Senior BJP leaders including several union ministers, too approached the Election Commission to counter the Congress's objections. "Since morning the Congress has been claiming it will win, but now, with defeat staring them in their face, they are making desperate attempts," said minister Ravi Shankar Prasad.</p>
<p>"Never seen such a tense and bitter battle in my entire political career," Ahmed Patel told NDTV as voting ended. He needs 45 Gujarat legislators to have voted for him to win his Rajya Sabha seat back.</p>
<p>Ahmed Patel, political Secretary to Congress president Sonia Gandhi, was counting on 44 of the Congress' 51 MLAs to support him - the others seen as loyalists of rebel leader Shankarsinh Vaghela. But one of the 44 is confirmed to have voted too against him.</p>

<p>This means he is now depending on Chhotubhai Vasava, the lone Janata Dal (United) legislator and one of two MLAs from Sharad Pawar's Nationalist Congress Party (NCP); the other said he would vote for the BJP. Mr Vasava told NDTV he has voted for Ahmed Patel but his party said he has voted for the BJP.</p>

<h2>Nitish Kumar has committed political suicide by joining hands with BJP: Lalu Prasad</h2>
<p>Patna: RJD supremo Lalu Prasad on Tuesday attacked Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar for walking out of the Grand Alliance government and said the JD(U) leader has committed "political suicide" by joining hands with the BJP.

<p>Using words like "treacherous Man Singh" and "Ranchhor" (one who quits battle field), Prasad said, "No party in the country would any longer trust Nitish... he is politically finished now."</p>

<p>"Nitish has committed political suicide by joining hands with the BJP," Prasad told reporters.</p>
He said that Kumar will not get more than two seats, which is currently with the JD(U), in the next parliamentary election.

<p>"The BJP and the NDA would not spare their current seats from the state for him in 2019 poll," he said. "I always considered Nitish to be more mature than me but he has proven me wrong... I feel sorry for him."</p>

<p>Prasad also refuted the charge of Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi, who has alleged a "nexus" between the former's family and a sand mafia. Sushil had also alleged that the sand mafia was "funding" RJD's proposed rally on 27 August.</p>

<p>"We have not taken even a single penny from him for the rally. It was rather Sushil Modi who had given him a contract for sand mining during previous NDA rule in Bihar," the RJD chief said adding, "Let them spin stories against us. We would expose them in 27 August rally at Patna."</p>

<h2>Abrogation of Article 35A : Mehbooba Mufti calls on Farooq Abdullah to discuss political situation</h2>
<p>Srinagar: In an unexpected move, Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Mehbooba Mufti on Tuesday called on Opposition National Conference president Farooq Abdullah to discuss the prevailing political situation in the state.</p>

<p>Mehbooba Mufti drove to the high-security Gupkar Road residence of Abdullah in the evening for the meeting, which was described as "cordial".</p>

<p>Posting a comment on the meeting, Abdullah's son and former chief minister Omar Abdullah posted on his widely followed Twitter handle: "Mehbooba Mufti called on JKNC president this evening to discuss the prevailing political situation in the state. It was a cordial meeting."</p>


<p>"With an aim to create a wider consensus amongst like minded parties in this battle to prevent Art 35A being struck down in the Supreme Court," he said in another tweet.</p>

<p>The debate surrounding the Constitution's Article 35A is gradually heating up in the state following a petition in the Supreme Court that has sought abrogation of the article giving powers to the J&K legislature to define permanent residents of the state and their privileges.</p>

<p>On Monday, the elder Abdullah had chaired a meeting of Opposition leaders of the state at his residence where issues related to Article 35A were discussed and later told the media that its abrogation would cause an uprising the government might not be able to handle.</p>
